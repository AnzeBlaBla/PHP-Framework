# PHP Framework

This is a PHP framework that is just a fun little project so I have something to do. It is not meant to be used in any way, as it's very bad.

## Functionality

The framework is very simple. The basic idea is that every component is it's own file, then you can reuse components with different props.

## Goal

My goal was to create a tool where all the logic (frontend and backend) + styles could be in one file (similar to Next.js).

## Todo

- [ ] File system routing
  - [x] Basic functionality
  - [x] Dynamic routes
  - [x] Layouts
  - [x] Rewrites and redirects
- [ ] Documentation
